# Maple-Seed-Design-and-Dynamics

Run the Script Maple.m to generate all the Plots and Dynamics Equations for the Autorotating Maple Seed Payload.

The Script Produces:

- Shape of the Maple Seed Payload
- Twist Angle for 3D Modelling
- Angle of Attack of the Propellor
- Lift Coefficient vs the Distance from Center of Mass
- Accelaration wrt time
- Descent Velocity wrt time
- Displacement wrt time
- Angular Velocity wrt time
